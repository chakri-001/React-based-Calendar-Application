## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing the project files
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.


1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chakri-001/calendar-app.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory: Once cloned, move to the project directory:**
    cd calendar-app
3. **Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all required npm packages:**
    npm install
4. **Start the Development Server: To run the app in development mode, use the following command:**
    npm start
**This will start the React app and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.**
    Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a hot reload in the browser.
**Usage**
**Once the app is up and running, you can interact with the calendar:**
**Calendar View:** The default view is the month view.
**Navigation:** Use the arrows at the top of the calendar to navigate between months.
**Mobile Friendly:** The app is fully responsive, thanks to TailwindCSS, and adjusts its layout for smaller screens.
**Run Tests**
  npm test
**Build for Production**
**To create a production-ready build, run**
  npm run build

You can adapt this to your specific app and needs, such as adding further customization for deployment steps or app functionality.
**Deployment**
To deploy the app, you can choose from various platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku. Below are the basic steps for deployment:

**Deploy to Vercel**
Install the Vercel CLI or use the Vercel website.
Push the app to a GitHub repository if you haven't already.
Link your GitHub repository to Vercel and follow the instructions to deploy.
**Deploy to Netlify**
Push the app to a GitHub repository.
Go to Netlify and create an account.
Create a new site from Git, select your GitHub repository, and Netlify will automatically build and deploy the app.
Alternatively, you can deploy the app manually to a server by uploading the contents of the build/ directory.

**Application Functionality**
Calendar Display: The app integrates the FullCalendar library for displaying the calendar.
Responsive Design: TailwindCSS ensures the application is fully responsive and works well on devices of various screen sizes.
React Router: React Router is used for navigation, though currently, the app only supports the calendar view.
Minimal Setup: The app is simple and lightweight, intended to serve as a basic calendar with styling provided by TailwindCSS.
**Known Limitations**
Limited Views: Currently, only the month view is available. More advanced views (e.g., week or day view) are not implemented.
No Event Management: There is no functionality for adding, editing, or deleting events in the calendar.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: While the app works in most modern browsers, some older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) may experience minor layout issues.
Performance: The app may face performance challenges when handling a large number of events in the calendar.
No Authentication: The app does not support user authentication or session management, meaning there is no personalization or user-specific calendar views.
